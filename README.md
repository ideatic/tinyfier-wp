== Description ==
Make your wordpress instalation fly. Once enabled, this plugin will combine, compress and optimize  JS, CSS and HTML files to improve page load time.
How? Using the [tinyfier engine](http://www.tinyfier.com/), that also adds support for LESS files, automatic vendor prefix integration and much more.

*What's the different between this plugin and others performance plugins?* Unlike them `tinyfier-wp` uses an intelligent asset analysis in order to not break the initial load order, and it\'s very powerful detecting them (even when they\'re not included using `wp_enqueue` functions.

*Can I contribute to its development?* Of course, feel free to make your pull request to [the official repo](https://github.com/ideatic/tinyfier-wp) and we'll be glad to merge it.

This is still a **BETA VERSION**, more test are pending and the option page is not available yet.
